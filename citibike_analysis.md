# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 

This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Des Moines Analysis

According to [this link](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/desmoinescityiowa/PST045219), Des Moines had a population of 214,237 on July 1, 2019. This is compared to New York City's July 1, 2019 population (from the same database) of 8,336,817. Des Moines' population is approximately 2.57% of NYC's. 

## Estimated Number of Bikes

Without any other information, we might then estimate that bike-sharing in Des Moines would require about 2.5% as many bikes as in NYC. Before making any decisions though, we would want more details on city density, existing options for transportation, and so on. With the number of bikes in NYC at 13,983, 2.5% of that is almost 350.
